 # 1. Background/ Problem Statement:
Online reviews have become increasingly significant in recent years when it comes to purchasing
decisions. This is so that buyers can learn a lot of important information about the products or services
from these reviews. Spammers, however, may fabricate and create false reviews in order to promote
falsely or reduce the quality of the goods or services. Customers would be misled and make poor
decisions as a result of the spammers' actions. Consequently, identifying fake (spam) reviews is a major
issue.
To ensure the credibility of the reviews posted on a platform, it is important to use a strong detecting
model. Our Monitoring and Deleting Fake Reviews of Online Products System is designed to save efforts
and time by helping users identify spam reviews from different opinions quickly and also help in
purchasing valuable products from a trustworthy site.
# 2. OBJECTIVE:
The primary objective of the Monitoring and Deleting Fake Reviews of Online Products System is to
establish a robust and user-friendly platform that effectively addresses the issue of fake reviews in
online commerce. The key goals include:
1. Fraud Detection:
Implementing advanced mechanisms, such as IP address tracking, to identify and flag potential fake
reviews.
2. User Empowerment:
Empowering users with the ability to leave genuine reviews and make well-informed purchasing
decisions.
3. Administrative Control:
Providing administrators with tools to efficiently manage and monitor user activities, product reviews,

# 3. DATA DESCRIPTION:
The data architecture of the Monitoring and Deleting Fake Reviews of Online Products System is
designed to efficiently manage information essential for its core functionalities. User data comprises
attributes such as User ID, Username, Email Address, Password (encrypted), and Registration Date,
facilitating secure user authentication and activity tracking. The product data section includes attributes
like Product ID, Product Name, Product Description, Price, and Availability, forming a comprehensive
catalog to aid users in making informed purchasing decisions. User-generated reviews are stored in the
system's database, including attributes such as Review ID, User ID (foreign key), Product ID (foreign key),
Review Text, Rating, Timestamp, IP Address, and a Review Authenticity Flag. This dataset allows for an
in-depth analysis of reviews while tracking authenticity through IP addresses. Administrative logs
maintain a record of activities performed by administrators, including Log ID, Administrator ID (foreign
key), Activity Type (e.g., Review Deletion), and Timestamp. Finally, the system configuration data section
stores essential configuration details, ensuring adaptability and ease of maintenance. The use of a
relational database structure establishes connections between tables, ensuring data integrity and
efficient retrieval. Additionally, the system leverages IP addresses collected during the review process
for fraud detection, identifying patterns of repeated fake reviews originating from the same source.
